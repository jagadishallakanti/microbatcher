# MicroBatcher

MicroBatcher is a Go library designed to simplify the process of batching jobs for efficient processing. It allows developers to queue jobs and process them in batches, optimizing resource usage and improving performance for tasks that can be executed in parallel. This library is particularly useful for applications that need to handle a high volume of jobs with minimal latency.
