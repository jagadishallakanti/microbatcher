## MicroBatching Configuration Parameters

MicroBatching, as implemented in our system, leverages several key parameters for its configuration and operation. These parameters are designed to offer flexibility in how jobs are batched, processed, and how the overall system behaves. Below is a detailed overview of each parameter:

### Processor
The `Processor` acts as the core component responsible for processing batches of jobs. Implementing a processor requires adherence to the `BatchProcessor` interface, which involves taking a slice of jobs as input and returning a slice of job results. The `SimpleProcessor` example provided within our documentation serves as a practical guide for implementing custom processing logic.

### Batch Size
`Batch Size` determines the number of jobs that are grouped together for a single processing batch. Reaching this size triggers the batch to be sent to the processor for execution. Opting for a smaller batch size results in more frequent processing in smaller groups, beneficial for time-sensitive tasks. Conversely, a larger batch size can enhance efficiency by minimizing the processing overhead, albeit potentially introducing processing latency.

### Batch Interval
The `Batch Interval` specifies the maximum duration to wait before processing a batch of jobs, irrespective of whether the batch size threshold has been met. This parameter ensures that jobs are not indefinitely left unprocessed due to an unmet batch size, striking a balance between system responsiveness and processing efficiency.

### Result TTL (Time To Live)
Although not explicitly mentioned in the provided code, `Result TTL` (Time To Live) is a crucial parameter typically used to define the lifespan of processed job results before their disposal. This parameter aids in memory management by ensuring the removal of obsolete, unneeded results.

### shutdownFlag
The `shutdownFlag` is a channel utilized to signal the system's impending shutdown, facilitating a graceful termination process by ensuring the processing of all pending jobs before the system's cessation.

### jobQueue
The `jobQueue` serves as a channel for enqueuing jobs prior to their batching and processing, acting as the primary entry point for jobs into the MicroBatching system.

### results
A map or similar data structure, `results` is employed to store the outcomes of processed jobs, typically keyed by job ID. This setup allows for the asynchronous retrieval of job results.

### shutdownWG (sync.WaitGroup)
The `shutdownWG` (sync.WaitGroup) is instrumental in ensuring the processing of all jobs prior to the system's shutdown. It monitors the number of active jobs, permitting the system to cease operations only once all jobs have been duly processed.

These parameters and components collectively constitute the backbone of the MicroBatching system, enabling the efficient processing of jobs in batches while affording considerable flexibility in job handling and result management.
